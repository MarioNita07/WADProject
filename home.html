        <div class="box-design" style="background-color: rgba(64, 61, 252, 0.7)">
          <p>Extreme g-forces. Daring decisions made in the blink of an eye – and at 370km/h. Dramatically battling to be the best, Formula 1 drivers are more like fighter pilots than sportspeople.
             Only 20 get the chance to compete, and they push themselves – and their incredible machines – to the very limit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-design" style="background-color: rgba(64, 61, 252, 0.7)">
          <p>Formula 1 is a team sport. It needs to be to change all 4 tyres on a car in under 2 seconds! F1 teams design and build their cars and get them ready to race.
             Each has their own history. Each has their own unique approach. All want to be the fastest. But who should you root for?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-design" style="background-color: rgba(64, 61, 252, 0.7)">
          <p>Some sports play stadiums. Our 'stadiums' span cities.
             With 24 races in amazing locations across 5 continents, Formula 1 is truly an international sport.</p>
